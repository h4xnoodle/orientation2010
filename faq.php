<h2>How do I register?</h2>
<p>It is very important that you pre-register if you can. Please pre-register online. You may also pre-register at Student Life 101 in the SLC. If you need to wait until the week, you can register and pay on the morning of Frosh Week. If you have problems signing up for frosh week through the normal channels, contact Abhi, Julianne, Maria, or Patrick, the Math Orientation Directors  (orientat@math.uwaterloo.ca), and they will assist you.</p>
 
<h2>I missed the registration deadline. Now what?</h2>
<p>The deadline was set for the purpose of ordering frosh kits, shirts, etc. We will still take late registrations, but will only be able to supply you with your frosh kits, shirts, etc while supplies last. (This is Math's policy - we can not speak for other Faculties). We won't turn anyone away from our frosh week events if they have their frosh week bracelet, but it is very important that you pre-register if you can. You will be able to pre-register at Student Life 101 in the SLC, or you can register and pay at Central Registration on September 5th and 6th. If you have problems signing up for frosh week through the normal channels, (the registration card you got mailed), contact Abhi, Julianne, Maria, or Patrick, the Math Orientation Directors (orientat@math.uwaterloo.ca), and they will assist you.</p>
 
<h2>What is the point of Orientation? Why should I participate?</h2>
<p>Orientation Week is all about introducing you to an unfamiliar campus, an unfamiliar education style and a lot of unfamiliar people. The events planned for Orientation Week include tours of campus; not just seeing the buildings and places, but finding out what they do, and why they are there. You'll find out information about your classes, other courses, academic policies, student rights, extracurricular programs, what is expected of you, and loads of other information that you will find very valuable. Last, but not least, you'll meet people! You'll meet the people that you will depend on for help on assignments, notes when you miss class, and getting info that you missed while you were sleeping in class... You'll also meet your leaders - upper year students who have been around and know what's going on. Ask anyone - most of the friends people have at university are those that they met during frosh week or others they've met through those people.</p>
 
<h2>Do I absolutely need to participate in EVERY event?</h2>
<p>No, you do not. We realize that not everyone enjoys the same types of events and we all feel different ways at different times. So, if you don't like a particular event, or part of an event, that's OK! We won't be offended. In fact, if you tell one of your leaders that you don't want to do something, they can try to come up with alternatives that you (and others) might enjoy more!</p>
 
<h2>I'm not very outgoing... will I still enjoy Orientation Week?</h2>
<p>If you're shy, or more on the mellow side of things, that's completely fine! Some of the things that go on during frosh week seem to be high energy, but we realize that there are plenty of quiet people, and every effort will be made to include them, and ensure that they are introduced to campus life!</p>
 
<h2>What if I can't make it to all of the events?</h2>
<p>We hope you'll want to come to as many events as possible, but if you have something else you'd rather be doing, no one will get on your back for missing something. Take a look at the Math Orientation Schedule for 2010 and read the descriptions. See if there are some things you want/can come out for! They're sure to be a lot of fun!</p>
 
<h2>It's Orientation week and I'm completely LOST! What do I do?</h2>
<p>Never fear! Just head towards the Pink Tie on the side of the Math building! There are some friendly folk camped out at the base of the tie - they are the Tie Guard!!! These people have all the answers for you! They are an endless font of information for all, regardless of Faculty.</p>

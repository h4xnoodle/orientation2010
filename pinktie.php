<p>The Pink Tie is the official symbol for the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. Over the years the symbol of the Tie has encountered much history. There are four types of Pink Ties that can be seen across the Waterloo campus and although they get the most exposure during Orientation Week, the symbol of the Pink Tie is known world-wide. Across campus it is well known that a student wearing a Pink Tie is a student in the Faculty of Mathematics. To wear this symbol means that you have proved what it takes to be a member of the only Faculty of Mathematics in North America!</p>

<p>Pink ties given to first years in the past. What will yours look like?</p>

<h2>Types of Ties</h2> 
<h2>Standard Pink Tie</h2> 
<p>The Pink Tie is the symbol of the Faculty of Mathematics. Its purpose is to identify those students who have proven themselves to be a member of the Faculty of Mathematics. It is a very true honour to be able to wear the Pink Tie. A wearer of this tie has successfully completed the Earn Your Tie component of their Orientation Week.</p>

<p><b>Who Wears this Tie?</b></p>
<p>First Year Students, Team Leaders, Head Team Leaders</p> 


<h2>Inverted Pink Tie</h2> 
<p>The Inverted Pink Tie (a.k.a. the Black Tie) is used to identify Math students who have contributed significant time and energy to Math Orientation Week at the University of Waterloo. Anyone wearing this tie has completed the Earn Your Tie component of their Orientation Week and has shown the Fantastic FOC members that there is truly something special about them that represents the Faculty of Math in a unique light. People wearing this tie should be respected for the dedication they have put into Orientation Week.</p>

<p><b>Who Wears this Tie?</b></p> 
<p>The Black Ties, Teamsters, Tie Guard, The FOC</p> 




<h2>Dean's Pink Tie</h2>
<p>Though not much is known about this tie, we know this: There is only one in existence and rumour has it that it comes from Ralph Stanton's (see below) tie collection. In order to wear this tie you must be the Dean of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. It is truely an honour to wear this tie because if you are, you are the leader of the Faculty of Mathematics.</p>

<p><b>Who Wears this Tie?</b></p> 
<p>Thomas F. Coleman, Dean of Mathematics</p>


<h2>40-foot Pink Tie</h2> 
<p>See the history of the tie below.</p>

<h2>Legend of the Pink Tie</h2>
<p><img src="imgs/tie/pink_tie_on_building.jpg" alt="Pink Tie on MC" /></p> 

<p>A long time ago in a land not so far away, a Mathematician had a vision. He dreamed of a place where Mathies could roam free, uninhibited by societal pressures to study Arts or Science. He dreamed of a separate Faculty of Mathematics. And he chose Waterloo to realize his dream.</p> 

<p>Professor Ralph Stanton, the visionary behind the Faculty, also dreamed of ties. Striped ties. Dotted ties. He loved outlandish ties and his colleagues favoured his pink one. The pink tie soon came to be the unofficial symbol for Math at Waterloo.</p> 

<p>When the Math &amp; Computer Building celebrated its official opening in 1968, a giant 85 foot pink tie appeared on the outside of the building as a tribute to Professor Stanton and his valued contributions. Every year, Math Frosh learn to worship the tie and all it symbolizes.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, the pink tie has been subject to sabotage and kidnapping over the years. A ruthless terrorist sect formed, calling itself The Tie Liberation Organization. The TLO stole the math's icon in 1984 and travelled across Ontario, snapping photos of the famous pink fabric in such exotic locations as Sudbury, Ottawa, and Toronto.</p> 

<p>A new tie -- 40 feet long and 11 feet wide -- was promptly purchased when it became obvious that the TLO would not return the original. This purchase cost the MathSoc $540.35.</p> 

<p>Thus, the Tie Guard came to be. These intelligent, courageous, and loyal subjects have a specific job: to protect the sacred pink tie. Pink Tie Preservationist, Marco Koechli, a UW math grad, established the first Tie Guard by organizing a 24 hour watch during Frosh Week. Rival Faculties and terrorist organizations were no match for the Tie Guard and the pink tie miraculously survived. The Tie Guard is now a permanent fixture every Frosh Week and has evolved into a central information point for incoming math students.</p> 

<p>These students take the legend of the pink tie very seriously and some 1000 pink ties are distributed during Frosh Week to new Mathies. Over the years, the tie has seen various styles, ranging from an historical wide version popular in the 60s, to the skinny style favoured during the 80s. (A collection of photos and pink tie memorabilia can be viewed in the MathSoc office.)</p>

<p>Since 1968, the pink tie has become a sign of strength and unity in the Faculty of Mathematics. The Faculty was the first of its kind (having originally been part of the larger Faculty of Arts) and UW currently has the world's highest full-time enrollment in mathematics. UW students, staff, and faculty members alike are proud of the Faculty and especially the Legend of the Pink Tie. Long live the Tie Guard</p>

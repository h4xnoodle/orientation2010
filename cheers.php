<h2>The Biggest Tie</h2>
<p>The biggest tie<br />
I ever saw<br />
Was hanging from<br />
The MC wall<br /><br />
I looked at it<br />
And then I knew<br />
I wanted to be<br />
A Mathie, too<br /><br />
I stole the tie<br />
It made me laugh<br />
Because it's true<br />
That I love Math<br /><br />
And so began<br />
My new journey<br />
To be part of<br />
Math faculty<br /><br />
My school is sweet<br />
SWEET LIKE A FOX!<br />
Because I know<br />
UW Math Rocks<br /><br />
Row Row Row Reduce<br /><br />
Row, row, row reduce<br />
Madly down the page.<br />
One mistake and you'll be baked<br />
So check at every stage.<br /><br />

Sine Sine Cosine Sine<br />
Three point one four one five nine</p>
